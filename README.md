Objective:

  As mencioned above, projects uploaded here are ones given as school work from my CS class. 
  The objective of this is learning, as in how to use GitHub and getting use to it, as well as discussing about the projects with colleagues.(It also way more convinient than moving a usb drive around or uploading code to Google Drive).
