What is COLTEC?

About projects:

  As mencioned above, projects uploaded here are ones given as school work from my CS class. 
  The objective of this repository is mainly for learning purpose, as to how to use GitHub and getting use to it, and as well as discussing about the projects with fellow students, and a disclaimer, I'm not held responsable for other COLTEC students using my code in their own work, as that is not the objective of this git hub, I will maintain transparency about the existence of this repository with the school staff.



Personal Notes:

*Noote Noote: Not serious notes ahead, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnmAi53H520 .

- They did not ask us to use GitHub to upload our projects, nor have they teached us how to, y e t. I'm doing it for convenience's sake, and because why not?

- Best part of studying here must be our access to all the university libraries, and trees? Oh and there's also a good education thing? Probably just the trees actually.

- " printf("Hi mom"); "

- I have probably never used the Cambrigde Dictionary so often for so many common words so far. And also probably googled( ducked ducked goed, aktually?)  english words and phrases more often than I actually talked in english, if my grammar here is still wrong I'll be quite disappointed. BTW google translate sucks?
